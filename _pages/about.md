# -- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

# Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

# Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.

Hi, I'm Keya(Lillian) Hu (胡珂雅), a 4th-year CS undergraduate student from [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://en.sjtu.edu.cn/), [ACM class](https://acm.sjtu.edu.cn/home). I am an incoming PhD student at [MIT EECS](https://www.eecs.mit.edu/).

Over summer–winter 2024, I was a visiting student at [Cornell University](https://www.cornell.edu/), where I was fortunate advised by Prof. [Kevin Ellis](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~ellisk/). I worked on using program synthesis and transduction method to tackle few-shot concept learning [ARC (Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus)](https://github.com/fchollet/ARC-AGI) problem, which is a visual-puzzle game.

My research interests lies in **Program Synthesis, Machine Learning**. I am excited about building more data-efficient and more generalizable agent.
