# -- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

# Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

# Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.

Hi, I'm keya Hu (胡珂雅), a 3rd-year CS undergraduate student from [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://en.sjtu.edu.cn/), [ACM class](https://acm.sjtu.edu.cn/home). I participated in a project that explores emotion recognition using raw EEG signals through self-supervised methods as a research assistant in [BCMI labortary](https://bcmi.sjtu.edu.cn/), advised by Prof. [Wei-Long Zheng](https://weilongzheng.github.io/).

I'm currently a visiting student in Cornell University, advised by Prof. [Kevin Ellis](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~ellisk/). I am working on utilzing LLM to augment dataset of non-language based, such as [ARC (Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus)](https://github.com/fchollet/ARC-AGI) problem, to enlarge LLM's excellent ability to non-language based tasks.

My research interests lies in **Artificial Intelligence, Cognitive Science, Program synthsis, and Large language model**.
